# 🏠 Personal Cloud Server Lab with Docker & Nextcloud

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey in IT infrastructure, Linux, and self-hosted services. I'm building my own cloud environment using **Docker** to run services like **Nextcloud** — an open-source alternative to Google Drive or iCloud — on my personal MacBook Pro.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Project

After completing the first 3 courses of the **Google IT Support Certificate**, I wanted to apply the concepts in a real-world environment — not just in theory. This project helps me:

- Practice **Linux commands and terminal usage**
- Learn and apply **Docker and containerisation**
- Understand **web services, databases, and networking**
- Build and manage a useful **self-hosted cloud service (Nextcloud)**
- Use **Git and GitHub** for version control and documentation

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Practiced

| Technology        | Why I'm Using It                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Docker**        | To run apps in isolated containers without needing VMs |
| **Docker Compose**| To manage multi-container setups like Nextcloud + MariaDB |
| **Nextcloud**     | To host and manage my own cloud storage and syncing service |
| **Linux CLI**     | To work with files, directories, and container management |
| **Git + GitHub**  | To document and track the progress of my setup |
| **Networking basics** | To expose services like Nextcloud through ports (e.g., localhost:8080) |

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

- How to install and run Docker on macOS (Apple Silicon)
- How to write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services
- How to start and manage containers
- How to set up Nextcloud through the browser and link it to a database
- How to upload and manage files in a private cloud

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

✅ Phase 1 – Set up Docker and Nextcloud  
🔜 Phase 2 – Add a media server (Jellyfin)  
🔜 Phase 3 – Set up password manager (Vaultwarden)  
🔜 Phase 4 – Add HTTPS (Let's Encrypt), remote access, and backups  
🔜 Phase 5 – Expand with automation, firewall rules, and multi-device sync

## 📚 Background

This is part of my transition from a high-paying chef job into the IT world. I’m studying the **Google IT Support Certificate**, building a personal lab, and learning hands-on through projects like this.
